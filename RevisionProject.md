While certainly a bit biased, this YouTube video from Vox does a good job summing up some of Trump's major foreign policy stances.
 

#### War

Trump has two main objectives when it comes to matters of war.  
One is that he wants to increase military spending and continue to grow the military.  His stance is that a strong military will discourage other nations from threatening the US.  
His other goal is to have less intervention in nations where we have no "direct threat to our interest."  He disagrees with our previous policy of supporting regime change in certain Middle Eastern countries.  He specifically has voiced displeasure in our current involvement in Syria, where we are backing rebels against the current leadership of Bashar al-Assad.
Another position worth noting is his stance on North Korea.  In a book he released in 2000, Trump said that he believes the US should be less leniant towards North Korean nuclear weapon development.  In Trump's words, "...North Korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice."

In terms of a plan to deal with ISIS, Trump says he has one, but has refused to divulge it in an effort to keep any and all details from enemy leaders.  The most detail he has given is that he plans to "...get rid of ISIS quickly."  
He has also been an outspoken critic of the nuclear deal that The Obama Administration made with Iran.


#### Trade
![trade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/16th_century_Portuguese_Spanish_trade_routes.png)

Trump has opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (commonly referred to as NAFTA), an agreement signed in 1994 which has the goal of promoting free trade between Canada, Mexico, and the US.  He supports a 35% tax on Mexican imports and a 20% tax on other imports.
In addition to opposing NAFTA, he has also said that he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a complex trade agreement between the US and 11 other countries. He instead insists that he will be able to negotiate better trade deals once he's in office.

#### Immigration
![mayflower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Plymouth_Mayflower_II.jpg)

Much of Trump's campaigning revolved around immigration policy. He promised to build a wall on the US-Mexican border and to be harsher on illegal immigration than previous administrations.  He has said that he wants Mexico to pay for this wall, though at this time it is unclear how or if he will actually make that happen.  He is against amnesty and so-called "sanctuary cities" where immigration law is not strictly enforced, citing that he believes this practice is not fair to those who have followed the legal immigration path. He also disagrees with birthright citizenship, meaning children of illegal immigrants born in the US would not be US citizens.


## Domestic Policy

#### Health Care
 ![hospital](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2452/3790640804_11748cd586_b.jpg)

Trump has been one of the Affordable Care Act's harshest critics.  He has said that he envisions a universal health care system, but he disagrees with the way it has been implemented in its current form.  He has said he aims to change the health care system but has yet to announce all the specifics of what his reforms will look like. One part of his plan that he has announced publicly giving insurers the ability to sell across state lines to encourage more of a free-market influence in the health care market. 
Another part of Trump's platform has been ensuring quality care for veterans. He has not addressed specifics, but still seems committed to this promise.


#### Homeland Security

While Trump originally called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the US, he has since softened his stance to a vetting process rather than an outright ban.  One of his more controversial Homeland Security positions is his support of the Guantanamo Bay detention center and their "enhanced interrogation" tactics, including waterboarding.  His exact statement was, "I'd bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse..."  
Trump also would like to extend the Patriot Act, which is used as the justification for mass data collection by the NSA. When asked about his decision, he said, "I tend to err on the side of security."

#### Crime
![handcuffs](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5532/14334518830_cb65613784_b.jpg)

Donald has said he supports stop-and-frisk tactics. This position is controversial due to the 2013 case which ruled the practice was being applied unconstitutionally in New York City. 
Trump has also been extremely defensive when it comes to police. He says he believes police officers are "...the most mistreated people in this country."
He has stated in his book, *The America We Deserve*, that he believes in capital punishment.

#### Environment
![environment](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/North_Cascades_at_Okanogan_National_Forest.jpg)

In an interview on *Fox News Sunday* in 2015, Trump said that he supported cutting the Environmental Protection Agency.  He takes a very fiscal approach to the environment and believes that jobs in the fossil fuel industry should be prioritized over environmental impact.  He has, at various times, spoken out against wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy, referring to them as bad investments.  In addition, he does not believe in climate change caused by greenhouse gases.

#### Economy
![cash](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6034/6355816649_3a1c1ab688_b.jpg)

Much of Trump's economic policy stems from his plan to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas, specifically from Mexico and China. He also wants to bring GDP growth to a higher percentage.  He believes our current low growth is due to high taxes.
Trump has voiced great concern over the national debt, although he doesn't appear to have a specific plan as of yet to address the issue. He's also said he would cut the EPA and the Departement of Education entirely in order to reduce federal spending.

#### Education
![school](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Cathedral_of_Learning_Pittsburgh_(8180352799).jpg)

As was mentioned previously, Trump supports getting rid of the Department of Education, presumably leaving it up to the states individually.  He has stated support for charter schools and a voucher system, which is traditionally a more libertarian approach to education.  His basis for these views is that competition between schools will increase the quality of education overall. 
On the topic of student loans, Trump has said student debt should be refinanced to reduce interest payments.

#### Abortion
![plannedparenthood](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Planned_Parenthood_in_St._Paul.jpg)

While he was previously pro-choice, Trump has changed his position, at least publicly, to a pro-life stance.  While he has praised Planned Parenthood for their non-abortion work, he has also called to defund it.  He has also said in several interviews and debates that he would appoint Supreme Court justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion jurisdiction to the state level. 

#### Government Assistance Programs
![foodstamps](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program_logo.svg/2000px-Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program_logo.svg.png)

While Trump has said that he supports certain welfare and assistance programs, he believes that they provide too many benefits for too long, and that recipients often become dependent on the programs to the point where they no longer look for work.  He's stated he supports legislation that mandates welfare recipients actively seek employment to continue recieving benefits.


#### Drugs
![drugs](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/10000/velka/pills-296112807925762yuN.jpg)

Trump has stated that the current opiate epidemic in America is one of his priorities.  His plan aims to stop the opiates from being imported to the US from China, where many of these drugs originate.
As far as marijuana, Trump is not against the idea of recreational legalization, but also is not enthusiastic about it.  He favors a cautious approach, but ultimately is not an opponent of legalization or decriminalization.  He has, however, said that he believes medical marijuana should be available nationwide.
